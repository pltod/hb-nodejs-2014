# How to Install

``` npm i ```




# How to Run

* npm test

> runs the nodeunit test suite provided with the assignment

> beerAndFries.js is the self contained solution file. You can take it and run it with your test suite.

* npm run test-more

> runs tape test suite that also prints the beer-fries combination that must be made to achieve the high score


# Algorithm Description

* there is much simpler solution to this problem using sorting

* having the more complex versions allows experiments with recursion while calculating all possible combinations.

> possible optimization would be to try out using TCO if possible at all. Approach described here: http://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/understanding-recursion-in-functional-javascript-programming/

> detailed explanation of the solution is here https://github.com/pltod/hb-nodejs-2014-one/blob/master/src/beerAndFries.js
